# ðŸ•’ NE555 Timer LED Blinking Circuit ðŸŒŸ

**Circuit Description:**

The circuit is a basic timer circuit based on the NE555 timer IC (U1). It features an astable multivibrator configuration, which generates a continuous square wave output with a specific frequency determined by the values of resistors (R1, R2) and capacitor (C1). This square wave output can be used for various timing applications such as generating clock signals, pulse generation, etc.

**Operation:**

When power is applied to the circuit, the NE555 timer IC (U1) starts oscillating, generating a square wave output at pin 3 (OUT). The frequency of this square wave is determined by the values of R1, R2, and C1. The square wave output can be observed at TP2.

The green LED (D1) may indicate the power status, and the red LED (D2) might indicate some specific condition or event in the circuit.

The circuit can be customized and used for various timing applications by adjusting the values of resistors and capacitors according to the desired timing requirements.
